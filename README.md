# PicoVolumetric: A Volumetric Display Using Transparent OLEDs and Raspberry Pi Pico

Welcome to **PicoVolumetric**, an innovative project that brings 3D volumetric displays to life using transparent OLED screens and the Raspberry Pi Pico. This project demonstrates cutting-edge technology, and showcases skills in hardware design, embedded programming, and visual computing.

## Overview

PicoVolumetric is a proof-of-concept volumetric display that uses multiple transparent OLED screens stacked in layers to create a 3D visualization effect. By leveraging the Raspberry Pi Pico's processing power and GPIO capabilities, the project synchronizes the rendering of images across the OLED layers to produce a dynamic, interactive 3D experience.

This project is designed to highlight technical expertise in:

- **Embedded Systems Development**: Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico in C++/MicroPython to control hardware components.
- **Hardware Integration**: Interfacing transparent OLED screens with microcontrollers and designing a stable, modular frame.
- **3D Visualization**: Creating volumetric effects by rendering 2D slices of 3D objects across multiple transparent layers.
- **Optimization**: Ensuring smooth performance and synchronization across hardware components.


## Features

- **Volumetric Rendering**: Displays 3D objects by stacking 2D images on transparent OLED screens.
- **Compact Design**: Built with a small footprint using the Raspberry Pi Pico and lightweight materials.
- **Open Source**: Fully documented and customizable for further development.

## Technical Details

- **Microcontroller**: Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- **Display**: Transparent OLED screens (multiple layers)
- **Programming Languages**: C++
- **Power Supply**: USB-powered for portability
- **Frame**: Custom-designed modular frame for screen alignment and stability

## Applications

PicoVolumetric has a wide range of potential applications, including:

- **Education**: Teaching concepts in 3D visualization, physics, and engineering.
- **Prototyping**: Exploring new display technologies for consumer electronics.
- **Art Installations**: Creating visually stunning 3D art pieces.
- **Gaming**: Developing immersive gaming experiences with volumetric displays.
